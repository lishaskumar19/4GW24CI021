# 4GW24CI021 – 3rd Sem CSE(AI&ML)

Welcome to the **4GW24CI021** repository!  
This project repository contains the **3rd semester course work** for the Computer Science & Engineering program. It includes assignments, programs and lab exercises completed as part of the curriculum.

---

# Purpose of This Repository

The main objectives of this repository are:

To store lab programs for multiple subjects in one place

To maintain version control using Git and GitHub

To practice C programming, Operating Systems concepts, and Data Structures

To act as a reference repository for future learning and revision

# Programming Language Used
🔹 C Programming Language

All programs are written in C

C is used because it:

Provides low-level system access

Is essential for Operating Systems

Helps understand memory management & processes

# Tools & Environment

The programs in this repository were developed using:

Operating System: Windows / Linux

Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

IDE / Editor:

VS Code

Eclipse (for Java earlier, not used here)

Version Control: Git

Platform: GitHub

# Folder-wise Detailed Explanation
📂 .vscode/

Purpose:
Stores VS Code configuration files.

Contents may include:

Compiler paths

Debug settings

Build tasks

Why it is useful:

Makes compiling and running programs easier

Keeps development environment consistent

# 📂 DSA/ (Data Structures & Algorithms)

Purpose:
Contains programs related to Data Structures and Algorithms.

Concepts covered typically include:

Arrays

Linked Lists

Stacks

Queues

Searching algorithms

Sorting algorithms

Importance:

Builds logical thinking

Forms the foundation for advanced programming

Important for interviews and exams

# 📂 SKILL LAB/

Purpose:
Contains Skill Lab practical programs.

Focus areas:

Improving problem-solving skills

Strengthening C programming basics

Writing clean and readable code

Includes:

Source files (.c)

Compiled executables (.exe)

# Operating Systems Programs (os1.c – os9.c)

Each file demonstrates one core Operating Systems concept.

# os1.c

Concept: Process creation

Uses system calls like fork()

Demonstrates parent and child processes

# os2.c

Concept: Process execution

Uses exec() family functions

Replaces process memory with a new program

# os3.c

Concept: Process synchronization

Demonstrates coordination between processes

# os4.c

Concept: CPU Scheduling

Simulates scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, etc.)

# os5.c

Concept: Memory Management

Shows memory allocation techniques

# os6.c

Concept: Deadlocks

Demonstrates deadlock situations or prevention

# os7.c

Concept: File Management

Uses file system calls like open, read, write

# os8.c

Concept: Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Pipes / shared memory / message queues

# os9.c

Concept: Advanced OS concepts

Combines multiple system calls

# DSA Program Files (pg1.c – pg8.c)

These files represent general lab programs or practice problems.

Features:

Demonstrate logic building

Practice control structures

Improve debugging skills

# JAVA Lab programs
This section contains Java lab programs related to:

Object-Oriented Programming concepts

Classes and Objects

Inheritance and Polymorphism

Exception Handling

Multithreading

Packages and Interfaces

OuterInner Class

Matrix Addition

Abstract Class

Programs are written in Java and follow standard lab guidelines.



# Executable Files (.exe)

Purpose:

Pre-compiled versions of C programs

Useful for quick testing on Windows

Note:

On Linux, these need to be compiled again using GCC

# .gitignore

Purpose:

Prevents unnecessary files from being pushed to GitHub

Keeps the repository clean

Examples of ignored files:

Temporary files

Build artifacts

System-generated files

# LICENSE

License Used: MIT License

Why MIT License?

Allows free use

Can modify and redistribute code

Simple and student-friendly
